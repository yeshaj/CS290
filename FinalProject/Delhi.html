            <p>New Delhi is the capital of India, located in the National Capital Territory of Delhi. There are
                many different sites to see in New Delhi. As a lot of governmental sites are there, there are some
                monuments that are specifically focus on a larger number of Indians rather than a specific historical
                figure. For example, the India Gate is a monument that was built as a way of remembering the 80,000 soldiers
                that were killed during the World War I.  <br><br>
            
                The Qutab Minar is a monument that was built by Qutub-ud-Din Aibak after the Muslims defeated the last 
                Hindu leader in Delhi. The monument is 73 meters tall, which makes it the tallest minaret in the world.<br><br>
            
                New Delhi is also home to one of the most important temples for Hindus, known as the Akshardham Temple. Akshardham
                means the divine home of God, and the temple is a place of worship and a spiritually enriching experience for 
                Hindus and non-Hindus alike. Alongside the temple and different educational exhibitions, the temple also holds a 
                fun water show after Sunset, which tells a story through lights, video projections, sounds, and water jets. </p>
