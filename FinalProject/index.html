                <p> Hello! My name is Yesha Jhala. I have lived in the Portland, Oregon area for almost 19 1/2 years, and
                    identify as an Indian American. As a PDX girl, I've learned to love the nature and city life all the same. 
                    Growing up, I've loved going on hikes, skiing down Mount Hood, exploring Downtown, and spending sunny (yet
                    also windy) days at the beach. I've also traveled to different places in the US, and love seeing what each
                    state has to offer, especially the different foods. I make sure I get the most out of each place I go, even
                    though I'm a vegetarian and sometimes it's a little hard to do that. <br><br>   
                    
                    Growing up, I traveled to India many times. While my home was in the western
                    parts of India, I've traveled to many different parts of India and usually try to go to at least one new 
                    state every time I'm there. Some places include Uttar Pradesh, NCT Delhi, Punjab, Maharashtra, Goa, Chennai,
                    and Kerala. Traveling can get super tiring sometimes, but the memories I have with my family at each place
                    has made it completely worth it each time. My favorite memory is probably from 2018 when I went to Kerala
                    and got to ride on an elephant. Let me just say though, if you ever plan on doing that, make sure you stretch
                    your legs beforehand. <br><br>

                    Currently, I'm a third year student at Oregon State University. I am studying towards a Computer Science degree.
                    I always knew that I'd end up into Computer Science in the future because of the classes I had taken and the projects
                    I had done in the past years. My first project was creating a computer game with some friends in 6th grade and 
                    I made an iOS game by myself. Since then, I knew that there was a lot that this program could offer and it'd be a ton 
                    of fun to see where it takes me. <br> <br>

                    In my free time, I love to dance. My favorite place to perform is at Pioneer Square in downtown Portland. Every year, 
                    there's an Indian Independence Day celebration there, where people can perform in front of thousands of people. While 
                    it's absolutely terrifying, performing in the open air and seeing people enjoy your performance is just a different 
                    type of happiness for one. Along with the amazing acts, the food is amazing and the people are all extremely nice. <br><br>

                    Other than dancing, I love hanging out with my friends and family, watching a ton of movies, and going on walks/runs, 
                    especially while listening to some high energy music. I'm also in the Indian Student Association as the current Co-President 
                    which keeps me busy pretty often. I also am an Ambassador for Society of Women Engineers and a member of ACM-W.
