            <p>The city of Agra is an extremely popular tourism area, known for its ancient and historical sites, as it
                was the capital of India before it was changed to Delhi in the 1600s. Most importantly, it's known for the different Mughal related areas. One of             the most known attractions in Agra, and also in all of India is the Taj Mahal. The Taj Mahal is also known as one of the 7 Wonders of the World. 
                The Taj Mahal was made by the Mughal emperor at the time, Shah Jahan, to keep the tomb of his wife. It took about 20 years
                and over 20,000 workers to build this marbelized structure, and later also housed the tomb of Shah Jahan after
                he passed away. <br><br>
            
                Another attraction that's extremely popular is the Agra Fort. Until the mid 1600s, it was where many of the Mughal emporers lived. It was 
                made with red sandstones, which is the reason for its other name, Red Fort. The Agra Fort is known for its historical importance as a military
                base, as well as a government residential area. <br><br>
            
                An attraction that's also widely known by tourists is the Tomb of Akbar the Great. Akbar was known as "Akbar the Great" for his multiple 
                accomplishments, such as destroying the large difference between Muslims and non-Muslims, which showed his respect towards non-Muslims.
                While he was still alive, he started creating a structural site where his tomb would lay. The monument was constructed with white marbles
                and sandstones, and surrounded by a beautiful garden, home to many different animals.</p>
