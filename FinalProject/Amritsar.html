            <p>Amritsar is a city in Punjab, India, which is in the Northern parts of India. The beautiful temple is made of gold
                and is the holiest shrine for people who believe in Sikhism. The temple is not only known for that, but attracts a 
                large number of devotees and visitors, as well as feeds over 100,000 people free food every day. <br><br>
            
                The Wagah Border is a ceramony that takes places between the Indian Border Security Force and Pakistan Rangers every day before 
                sundown. The ceramony is lasts for about 45 minutes, where the main idea is to close down the borders and lower the National flag
                for the night. However, there are many things that happen during the ceramony. While the ceramony isn't that long, it's best to
                get there a couple of hours in advance, as there are thousands of people who come to watch every day. Each side blares its nation's music,
                as people dance and express their love towards their country. During the ceramony, the soldiers each perform a type of marching, which
                is seen to be a way of representing a battleground. While they show their rivalry, they also show the cooperation with their neighboring
                country. <br><br>
            
                Jallianwala Bagh is a garden known to be of great historical importance in India. In 1919, the General of the British colonies was convinced
                that there would be an uprising, leading him to cancel all meetings for April 13th. However, as it was not widely distributed amongst people, 
                a large group of Indians met up at the Jallianwala Bagh to hold a peaceful protest. The General then ordered troops to travel there and aimlessly
                fire their rifles. Over 370 people were killed, and 1,000 people were injured. The garden still has bullet holes on the walls and signs that show
                where the troops fired from. </p>
